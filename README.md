# Chat with any CSV ðŸ“Š

A Streamlit-based application that allows users to interact with CSV files through a conversational interface. Upload your CSV, ask questions about its contents, and get intelligent responses powered by a Large Language Model (LLM).

---

## Features
- **CSV Upload**: Upload and preview CSV files directly in the app.
- **Intelligent Query Handling**: Ask questions about your CSV's contents, and get accurate, AI-generated responses.
- **Chat Interface**: User-friendly chat interface for seamless interaction.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes Groqâ€™s `llama3-70b-8192` model for intelligent and contextual responses.

---

## How It Works
1. **CSV Upload**:
   - Users upload CSV files, which are displayed in the sidebar for preview.
   - Validates the CSV file to ensure it is not empty.

2. **Question Answering**:
   - Users input prompts through a chat interface.
   - The app processes the query using a CSV agent integrated with the Groq LLM.
